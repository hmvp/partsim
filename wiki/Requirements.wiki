== Summary ==

*These quotations should be made a bit more concise!*

  * "There is a bounded rectangle R (of size 800 in the x-direction and 600 in the y-direction) containing N particles.  Each particle has a location within R, a direction of movement and a speed.  Particles behave naturally when they bounce at the boundary of R.  Particles have size 0, and (for reasons of ease) several particles may be on the same location.  The movement of one particle does not disturb the movement of other particles. Each particle has a (not necessarily unique) name: a lower case letter or an upper case letter."
  * "The initial configuration of the particles will be read from file (containing the number of particles and for each particle its name, its location, its direction, and its speed)."
  * "In the animation the user has the possibility to input interactively a name n such that at least one particle with name n (if present) is removed from the simulation.  Similarly the user has the opportunity to present a name, a location, a direction of movement and a speed so that a new particle with the given characteristics is included in the simulation.  Moreover the user is offered a button on the screen to generate a new particle with a random name, a random location in R and a random direction of movement and random speed."
  * "The user must have the opportunity to slow down the simulation by setting a fixed amount of time t such that (about) time t elapses between start and finish of the computation of each round for each particle (and during this elapse time the thread is not allowed to do the computation for other particles.  This amount t can be interactively increased and decreased by the user."
